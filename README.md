# NSM Reports

NSM Reports is an extensible reporting engine for ExpressionEngine 2. 

NSM Reports allows users to run customisable reports on any data in the CP. Reports can be simple (a single SQL statement returning a CI AR results object) or complex (custom configuration, output etc).

* Report configuration can be saved as presets for CRON job usage
* Reports can be emailed to users when run as CRON jobs
* Reports are generated and saved on the server

## Developers

Let me know what you think of the base nsm_reports class and the implementation of third_party reports.

* Reports are located in /reports checkout the examples
* Developer docs (PHPDoc) are found in /docs/dev

## Report Ideas

* Simple commerce data
* Member data
* Channel stats
* Third party addon data
