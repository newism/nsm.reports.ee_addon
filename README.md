# NSM Reports

NSM Reports is an extensible reporting engine for ExpressionEngine 2. 

NSM Reports allows users to run customisable reports on any data in the CP. Reports can be simple (a single SQL statement returning a CI AR results object) or complex (custom configuration, output etc).

* Report configuration can be saved as presets for CRON job usage
* Reports can be emailed to users when run as CRON jobs
* Reports are generated and saved on the server
