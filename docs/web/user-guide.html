<p>These options control the report download permissions for your website. Member groups specified here are granted permission to download generated reports if they are successfully logged in. The following options are shown for the download configuration:</p> 
<dl> 
	<dt>Generated reports path</dt> 
	<dd>This is the server path that will be used to store generated reports. 
		Reports that are generated by NSM Reports are saved in this location and a download link is sent to the report's recipient email address. 
		It is mandatory that this directory has sufficient read/write permissions assigned to it. 
		We suggest that this directory should be outside of the public website directory for security.</dd>
